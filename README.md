I did this project on gltich instead of locally on an IDE.

Include a very brief summary of your project here: My project is a basic WebAudio visualization for the audio from SEGA's 1991 original Sonic The Hedgehog title screen. Use the "click me!" button to play audio and visual. Use input items on the page to change different aspects of the visualization. User can edit the Bar Height, Color Intensity of each bar, Bar Width, and the Frequency Range of the audio.

The goal of the application is to refine my JavaScript knowledge while exploring the multimedia capabilities of the browser using WebAudio with Canvas. Challenges I faced in realizing the application include the actual styling and coloring of the audio visualization, and how CSS works with WebAudio visualization.
