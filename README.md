## Audio Visualizer


Hosting link: http://a4-Winston-Lewis.glitch.me <br>


The goal of this application was to create an audio visualizer for a song using Canvas & Web Audio API, and allow users to edit various aspects of the visualizer/song. Specifically, the height of the bars, the width of the bars, the amount of lower audio frequencies allowed, and the color of the bars are what I wanted users to be able to edit.<br>

When creating the application, my main challenge was implementing the different user-controlled features. I initially tried using Tweakpane for the UI, but I kept having issues when trying to import its package. I resolved this issue by creating my own labels and inputs for user features, and I essentially created a UI independently of Tweakpane.
