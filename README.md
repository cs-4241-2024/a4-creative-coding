## Sophia's Online Ukelele

Glitch: https://a4-sophiajohnn.glitch.me

This website provides an interactive ukelele that plays notes when you click on the strings. It also provides the ability to adjust the volume, show labels on the strings, and even change the background. 

While creating this website I had trouble getting the chords to play with the wav files. 

For the CSS of the ukelele I got some inspiration from this website https://www.cssbattlesolutions.com/78-ukulele and added onto it/made changes as well.
