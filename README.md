## Torus Knot Geo!

**GLITCH:** [a4-gabriel-curet-irizarry.glitch.me](a4-gabriel-curet-irizarry.glitch.me)


This application is a Torus Knot simulator that allows us to edit its geometry. It makes use of Three.js for the shape geometry, rendering of the shape, and camera control. It also makes use of Tweakpane for the controls of the simulator wich are connected to the parameters of the shape generated. Besides controlling the shape's geometry with the twekpane panel you can also change the color of the shape and the speed at which it rotates in both axes. 

- The goal of this application is to simulate the geometry of a Torus Knot while giving the user the liberty to change its parameters so that they may create creative shapes.
- The biggest challenge faced was getting Tweakpane panel to display the sliders how I wanted and then updating the parameters from the torus know geometry got from three.js.
