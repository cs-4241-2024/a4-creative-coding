## Circular 2D Audio Visualizer

Hosting Link: http://a4-thomas-oleary.glitch.me

I created a 2D Audio Visualizer. I was inspired to try to create a circular visualizer, which ended up being a tougher task than originally expected.
I needed to use some trigonometry to figure out how to draw the sound bars around the circle, and mess with transforms.

This visualizer is set to run a song called "Moonlight" by しがない高校生. I chose this song because I think its bass and overall emphasis on rythm uses the visualizer well.
The user can use a button to play or pause the song, and can use various color pickers to change the look of the visualizer. There is also a volume slider which works as you'd expect.
The mp3 file I used for the song takes a second or two to start making noise.
