## Three.Js Ski Game

https://a4-mkneuffer.glitch.me/

I decided to use Three.js to make a game. Its a sskiing game. In this game you controll a skier as they go down hill, you have to use the arrow keys to avoid the trees. If you hit a tree, its game over. The goal is to survive as long a possible in order to get the high score. All scores are saved to the server and database. The highscore is displayed in the top right of the screen.

- The goal of this application was to create a 3D game, taking user interaction and inputs.
- To start the game, click the "Start Game" button. To control the skier use the Left and Right Arrow keys. When the player dies, they will be prompted to enter their name. When entered, their name and score will be save to the Database.

## Implemented Require Functionalities

- A server created using Express. (Scores and names are save to it)
- A client-side interactive experience using Three.JS
- A user interface for interaction with your project (Start button and the prompt for the user to input their name)
- display basic documentation for the user interface (start game screen tells the player the controls)
