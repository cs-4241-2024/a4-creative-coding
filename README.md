## Palette Lock Drawing App

https://a4-ananya-jayamoorthy.glitch.me/ 

I made a simple drawing web app for this project. The goal was to make something that looked like MS Paint because I liked the look and also I wanted to make a drawing app that gives the user a restriction. I called this site Palette Lock because the user doesn't get to choose what colors they use, instead they are given a palette and have to draw with that.

Project Requirements:
- Web Technology Framework Used: Canvas
- Interactive Features
    1. Draw Button: The user can draw whatever when this button is active.
    2. Erase Button: The user can erase previous strokes.
    3. Line Thickness Slider: The user can click a button to bring up the slider that controls pen size.
    4. Clear Canvas Button: The user can clear the canvas in one go.
    5. Save Button: The user can download their drawings as jpegs.
    6. Color Bar: The user is given a color bar to pick from and draw.
 
My biggest challenges were finding how to get the user to be able to write on the screen (as in, the main feature of my idea) and the styling. I feel like my CSS stylesheet looks polluted and convoluted but at least the webpage looks nice!

*heads up: the buttons in the top right corner of the webpage are just there for decoration*
