## Canvas Paint

https://a4-henryhribar.glitch.me

Canvas Paint is a simple application where you can draw on a canvas. Users have the ability to change the stroke color, change the stroke size, erase, fill the canvas with a color, and clear the canvas of all color. The point of this application is for users to simply relax and be creative through the act of drawing.

There was a little bit of a challenge for me obtaining the current input values for color and size; I realized that I needed to use event handlers to get these values.
