This app uses d3.js. It allows you to plot the coordinates of (x, y) on a 100 X 100 plane. You can customize the color and radius of each point that you plot. To clear the plane press the clear button. The main difficulties I faced were getting d3 set up and learning how to plot svg on the plane. I have four user inputs that can manipulate the graph.
