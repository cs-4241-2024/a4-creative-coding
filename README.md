## Pokemon Data Visualization

http://a4-kenyon-coleman.glitch.me/

The site displays three different data visualizations using a pokemon json dataset. The first is a pie chart based on pokemon type. The second is a scatterplot matrix based on four different statistics, height, weight, spawn chance, and average spawns. The last visualization is a force directed graph, which shows the evolutionary lines between different pokemon.
