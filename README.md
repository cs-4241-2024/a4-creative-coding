## Data Visualization for Earth Meteorite Landings

GOAL: The goal of my application was to use D3/SVG in order to create some different visualizations for the data provided at https://data.nasa.gov/resource/y77d-th95.json. I utilized two of the examples that D3 has on its website: Horizontal Bar Chart and Scatterplot. The user can control what data fields they want to look at by clicking on one of the four buttons.

CHALLENGES: I spent a lot of time trying to get the examples from D3 to work. I had to edit/tweak some of the code in order for it to work in my project. D3 has a lot of different functions so it took a bit to get used to what everything was doing, and some of it is still a mystery to me. Once I got the first bar chart working, it wasn't too difficult to make the other options, but it felt like I was banging my head against the metaphorical wall for a while with this project. I also tried to use tweakpane, but I couldn't figure out how to incorporate it into the project (it kept saying that Pane was not recognized even though I tried a few different methods of installing/importing it). I was hoping to make the project a bit more interactive than just using the buttons, so I'm hoping the buttons have enough "user interaction".
