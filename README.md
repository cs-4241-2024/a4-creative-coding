## Pokédex Visualization

Link: https://a4-azzhang3.glitch.me

**Goal of the Application**

The goal of this application is to help users visualize and interact with Pokémon data, providing insights into various Pokémon characteristics. By allowing users to compare different Pokémon and filter the data, the app aims to enhance the user experience when exploring the dataset, offering a visually engaging way to analyze Pokémon information.

**Key Features:**
- Candy Count Bar Chart: Displays the candy count for each Pokémon, allowing users to compare different Pokémon based on their candy count.
- Weakness Radar Chart: Visualizes the weaknesses of two selected Pokémon on a radar chart, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses for comparison.
- Interactive Tooltips: Hover over any Pokémon in the charts to get detailed information like name, height, weight, candy count, and weaknesses.
- Dynamic Filtering: Users can filter and compare Pokémon based on various parameters like height, weight, and weaknesses.

**Issues:**
- Many graphs were attempted, including bar charts, pie charts, and matrix graphs. 
- The filtering does not stack, meaning if you filter by height, then candy gets turned off. This was done because there weren't enough Pokemon entries to have multiple filters.
- The radar chart also looks good with some pokemon with typings closer together in the radar, but if it is further apart, the radar looks a little weird.
