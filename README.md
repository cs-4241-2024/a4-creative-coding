## Quick Cube Clicker: 3D Web Game

Vercel: a4-hanna-trinh.vercel.app

# Brief Overview
Quick Cube Clicker is a very simple game, interactive 3D web game built with Node.js, Express, Three.js, and MongoDB. Players click on a rotating cube as many times as possible within a 30 second time limit. The game features customizable graphics and a list of sorted high scores.

# Key Features
- 3D graphics powered by Three.js
- Customizable cube properties and background colour
- Highscore leaderboard shown with a side bar

# Challenges Faced
Some challenges I faced was was learning how to implement Three.js and making sure performance is optimized. Additionally, I had to configrue a lot of server-side state for configurations which took a while because the numbers needed to be parsed. Again deploying a full stack application which uses cors and different routes for frontend and backend was difficult. I had to redeploy my application too many times and had to research different configs which will work for my not too traditional vercel folder tree.

# How to Play
1. Click the cube to start the game.
2. Click the cube as many times as possible within 30 seconds.
3. Enter your name to save your score when the game ends.
4. View high scores by clicking the arrow on the right side of the screen.
5. Customize the game by clicking the "Customize Game" button and adjusting the settings.

# Additional Instructions
- Custom settings are loaded automatically and will be loaded the next time the game reloads

Enjoy!
