https://a4-cc-jjcool1128.glitch.me

Goal of the Application:
The goal of the application is to provide users with an interactive audio visualizer for MP3 files. Users can upload an MP3 file, visualize the audio in real time, and customize the visualizer's appearance and behavior through various controls, such as changing the bar width, amplitude, color (using RGB sliders), and playback speed. Additionally, users can download a default audio file from the website if they don’t have their own MP3 file to upload.

Challenges Faced:
Synchronization of Audio and Visualizer: Ensuring that both the audio and the visualizer responded correctly to changes in playback speed required managing the playback rate and frame rendering in sync.
Dynamic Customization: Implementing real-time control for various visualizer parameters like bar width, amplitude, color, and speed without causing delays or crashes required optimization of the rendering process.
User Controls Placement: Ensuring the user interface was both functional and intuitive involved adjusting the layout for control sliders and buttons below the visualizer.
Resuming Playback: Making sure the visualizer resumed correctly when audio playback was paused and then resumed was crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience.

Instructions:
Upload MP3 File: To begin, upload an MP3 file by clicking the file chooser. You can also download a default audio file using the "Download Default Audio" button.
Customize the Visualizer: Use the following controls:
Bar Width Slider: Adjust the width of the frequency bars.
Amplitude Slider: Control the height of the frequency bars.
Visualizer Speed Slider: Control the speed of the visualizer and the playback speed of the audio.
Red, Green, and Blue Sliders: Adjust these to change the visualizer’s color by controlling the RGB values.
Play, Pause, and Resume: Start the visualizer using the "Start Visualization" button. You can pause the song using "Pause" and resume it using "Play."
