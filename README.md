This is a simulation of a slime mold, inspired by these two places:

This project is adapted from a hobby project I started over the summer, which is at the link below:

I created this simulation because I am fascinated that such organic complexity can derive from very simple rules. Each of 20,000 agents simply runs around a black canvas following each other.

See the instructions on the website for more details about the simulation and the settings you can change.
