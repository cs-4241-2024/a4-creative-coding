## Supermassive Black Hole Visualizer

https://a4-ian-poulsen.glitch.me

The goal of this application was to create a visualization for a song using Canvas and the Web Audio API.
This app uses an express server and tweakpane to allow for user interaction. I faced some challenges understanding the 
tweakpane documentation but other than that it was fairly smooth sailing!

The application has four user-interactive fields which control the width of the frequency bars, an amplitude magnifier, an invert option, and a color selector. The color selector was made with HTML instead of using tweakpane.
