      <h1>Slime Mold Simulation</h1>
      <p>
        This is a slime mold simulation, inspired by sources in the README. The
        simulation is made up of 20,000 agents with very simple logic. Each
        'agent' looks at two pixels in front of it and turns slightly towards
        the one that is brighter. Each agent also leaves a white trail behind,
        which decays over time. With the options on the top right, you can
        control the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Agent Velocity: The speed at which the agents move. Speeds greater
          than 1 (pixel per frame) produce dotted lines.
        </li>
        <li>Sense Distance: The distance of the sense pixels from the agent</li>
        <li>
          Sense Angle: The angle in radians left and right of the sensed pixels
          from the agent's current direction
        </li>
        <li>
          Decay Factor: The rate at which pixels decay from white to black
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn Speed: The angle in radians an agent can turn right or left
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Experiment with the settings! Beware, changing some settings too much
        will produce chaos. Reload the page to return to the defaults, which
        will produce a stable simulation.
