Title: Starlight Tunes

This project is a musical visualizer that creates a "starry night" of randomly-generated 3d shapes to the tune of Wintergarten's Marble Machine, employing the use of BPM analysis to create a fun, pulsing beat. It uses functions to generate shapes randomly across the page and allows users to add their own filled with random colors, which they can then resize and recolor separately to the computer-generated ones. 

Dealing with the audio API provided some challenge, so I did a deep dive into how the API worked and feel far more confident in its usage-- I am so proud of the average frequency "pulse".

The instructions are on the head of the site! Have fun!
